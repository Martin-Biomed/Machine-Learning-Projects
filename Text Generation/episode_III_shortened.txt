

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main
Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.
War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless
Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil
is everywhere.
In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General
Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped
Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.
As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged
capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a
desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor...
Pan down to reveal a Republic Attack Cruiser. Continue to pan
with the Cruiser as Two Jedi Starfighters enter and head
toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. 
R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship.
A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships
continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.
OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship
rocks violently.
ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a Trade Federation Droid Battle Ship.
ANAKIN
There isn't a droid made that can
out fly you, Master, and no other
way to get to the Chancellor...
OBI-WAN
Look out, four Droids inbound...
 
After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the Trade Federation Droid Battle Ships
collide with each other in a ball of flame.
OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.
OBI-WAN
We've got to split them up.
ANAKIN
Break left, fly through the guns on
that tower.
OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a Republic
Cruiser
OBI-WAN
Easy for you to say... why am I
always the bait?
ANAKIN
Don't worry. I'm coming around
behind you.
OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's
superstructure, but the Droid Fighters stay on his tail,
Blasting him with intense laser fire.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, they're all over me!
ANAKIN
Dead ahead! Closing... lock onto
him, Artoo...
ARTOO beeps his reply as Anakin swoops in for the kill.
ANAKIN Blasts one of the Droid Fighters. It explodes.
ANAKIN
(continuing, laughs)
We got him, Artoo!
ANAKIN Blasts away at the second Droid Fighter as Artoo
beeps an angry warning.
ANAKIN
I copy, Artoo.
OBI-WAN
I'm going down on the deck.

ANAKIN
Good idea... I need some room to
maneuver.
OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger Droid Battle Ship
and is forced to fly through a
maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by
the Droid Fighters, which is followed by Anakin.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut
right. Don't let him get a handle on
you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock
on!
ARTOO beepsS. The crosshairs merge on the Droid Fighters.
OBI-WAN
Hurry up! I don't like this!
OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a
Battleship. The Droid Fighter hits one of Obi-Wan's
wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying
around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, Arfour.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Ouch!
R-4 beepsS a blue streak.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Don't even try to fix it, Arfour.
I've shut it down.
ANAKIN
We're locked on... we've got him...
ANAKIN drops in behind the Droid Fighter and blows him
apart. ARTOO squeals with delight.
ANAKIN
(continuing))
Yeah! We got him... good going,
Artoo.
OBI-WAN
Next time you're the bait... Now
let's find the Command Ship and get
on with it...
R-4 beeps a blue streak.

ANAKIN
Lock onto them, Artoo. Master,
General Grievous's ship is directly
ahead.
ARTOO beeps a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
The one crawling with vulture
Droids.
OBI-WAN
I see it. Oh, this is going to be
easy.
Ahead is a Trade Federation Cruiser with batlike Droid Fighters
stalking around on the hull. The Droid Fighters transform into flight configuration, 
lift off the Cruiser, and attack the Jedi Starfighters.
ANAKIN
Come on, Master.
OBI-WAN
Not this time. There's too much at
stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do
you copy?
ODD-BALL
Copy, Red Leader.
OBI-WAN
Mark my position and form your squad
up behind me...
ODD-BALL
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.
Set S-foils in attack position.
The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the
Trade Federation Cruiser, and six new Droid Fighters
emerge and join the Droid Fighters heading toward the
Jedi. The Jedi Starfighters extend the stability foils on the
ends of their wings.


ANAKIN
This is where the fun begins. Ten
Vulture Droids straight ahead,
coming down the left side.
ARTOO beeps a worried message.
OBI-WAN
Add five Tri-fighters on the
right...
ANAKIN
I'm going head to head. See you.
OBI-WAN
Take it easy, Anakin.
Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.
ODD-BALL
I'm on your right, Red Leader.
ANAKIN
Incoming!!
ARTOO squeals as five Droid Fighters pass by at high
speed on the right.
OBI-WAN
Five more on the right!
Four more Droid Fighters pass at high speed from the
left. All hell breaks loose. Obi-Wan and Anakin continue to
fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO squeals.
ANAKIN
Here we go.
The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the
Droid Fighters, ending up behind them. Blasting away. The
Droid Fighters Explode.
OBI-WAN
I'm going high and right.
ANAKIN
Hang on. There are four more of
them.
OBI-WAN
Stay with me... swing back and
right... help me engage. Back off
... Let them pass between us.

ANAKIN
I'm coming around. I'm coming around
on your tail.
OBI-WAN
All right, engage... and hurry.
These Droids are all over me like a
rash.
In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the fighter, 
blowing them away one by one until there is
only one left. ARTOO chirps.
ARTOO lets out a Howl as Anakin accelerates past the last
fighter, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter
around, and Blasts the Fighter from the front. ARTOO beeps
frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed
ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.
ANAKIN
How many back there. Artoo?
(Artoo beeps)
Three...
(continuing)
Four... that's not good.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, you have four on your tail.
ANAKIN
I know. I know!
OBI-WAN
Four more closing from your left.
ANAKIN
I know. I know!
OBI-WAN
Break right and go high.
ANAKIN
I'm going low and left.
Obi-Wan shakes his head.
OBI-WAN
(to himself)
He still has much to learn.
ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a Battle Ship, 
dodging flack as Artoo bounces along, trying to
get out a sentence.

ANAKIN
Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you
copy? I'm going to pull them through
the needle...
OBI-WAN
Too dangerous. First Jedi rule:
"Survive."
ANAKIN
Sorry, no choice. Come down here and
thin them out a little.
OBI-WAN drops in behind the Droid Fighters chasing
Anakin. ARFOUR beeps to Obi-WAN.
OBI-WAN
Just keep me steady... hold on...
not yet... now break left.
OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the
Droids, Blasting four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench
along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships.
He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with
a small slit between two main struts.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
You'll never get through there,
Anakin. It's too tight.
ARTOO beeps nervously.
ANAKIN
Easy, Artoo... we've done this
before.
OBI-WAN
Use the Force, think yourself
through, the ship will follow.
ARTOO squeals in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal
reads out, we're not going to make it.
ANAKIN
Wrong thought, Artoo.
ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing Droid Fighters crash.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I'm through.

OBI-WAN continues to fire on the Droid Fighters,
driving them into the Explosion. A Clone fighter is hit and
explodes, spewing debris. The pilot spins off into
space. Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling
up alongside ANAKIN. Clone Squad 7 battles the
Droids.
ODD-BALL
There are too many of them.
CLONE-PILOT-2
I'm on your wing. Break left. Break
left. They're all over me. Get them
off my...
ANAKIN
I'm going to go help them out!
OBI-WAN
No, no! They are doing their job so
we can do ours. Head for the Command
Ship!
Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins
off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to
locate its target and fires missiles at them.
ANAKIN
Missiles! Pull up!
Anakin and Obi-Wan break right and left, and the missiles
follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the
missiles following him to collide and Explode. Two missiles
continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right,
then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.
OBI-WAN
They overshot us...
The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wanâ€™s Fighter and
explodes. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, Screams as the
Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all
around them. ANAKIN: They're coming around!
OBI-WAN
All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing
too fancy.
ANAKIN
Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand
by the reverse thrusters.
ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.

ANAKIN
We got 'em. Artoo!
Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.
OBI-WAN
Flying is for Droids.
Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet
toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The
trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and
detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach
themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing Small
Buzz Droids that begin to crawl across the surface like
spiders.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
I'm hit! Anakin?
ANAKIN
I see them... Buzz Droids.
The Buzz Droids crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear
it apart.
Sparks Erupt where the Buzz Droids break into the wiring. One
of the Buzz Droids goes after Arfour.
OBI-WAN
Arfour, be careful. You have one...
ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.
OBI-WAN
Oh dear. They're shutting down all
the controls.
ANAKIN
Move to the right so I can get a
clear shot at them.
OBI-WAN
The mission. Get to the Command
Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm
running out of tricks here.
ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and
angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the Droids
crawling over Obi-Wanâ€™s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and
vaporizes the Two Buzz Droids, along with the left wing of
Obi-Wan's ship.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
In the name of...
ANAKIN
Steady... steady...
OBI-WAN
Anakin, hold your fire... hold your
fire. You're not helping here.
ANAKIN
I agree, bad idea. Swing right...
ease over... steady...
OBI-WAN
Wait... wait... I can't see a thing!
My cockpit's fogging. They're all
over me, Anakin.
ANAKIN
Move to the right.
OBI-WAN
Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get
us both killed! Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.
ANAKIN
I'm not leaving without you, Master.
ANAKIN moves his ship next to Obi-Wan's and tries to
physically knock the Buzz Droids off. There are five left. He
manages to get one off, but badly dents Obi-Wan's ship in the
process. One of the Buzz Droids tears apiece off of the front
of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows
out, obscuring the Jedi's view.
ANAKIN knocks off three of the Buzz Droids and the fourth
crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking Artoo.
ARTOO fights the Buzz Droid.
OBI-WAN
Blast it... I can't see... my
controls are gone.
ANAKIN
Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
OBI-WAN
Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center
eye.
ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the
swerving Buzz Droid. The Buzz Droid is hit squarely in the
eye and falls off the ship.
ANAKIN
Yeah, you got him!
OBI-WAN
Great, Artoo.
ANAKIN
Stay on my wing... the General's
Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy...
pull up... Head for the hangar.
OBI-WAN
Have you noticed the shields are
still up?
ANAKIN
Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter
and blasts the shield generator. It Sparks and explodes.
OBI-WAN
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
The shield door drops away, and Obi-Wan crashes on the deck
of the hangar bay, engulfed in Sparks. A set of
blast doors starts Slamming shut across the hangar opening,
as material is sucked into space.
ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the
hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the
cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship explodes. BATTLE
Droids rush at him from all directions.
ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the
Battle Droids to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of
the ship and follows Anakin.
OBI-WAN
Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
ANAKIN
Tap into the ship's computers.
They cut down the last of the Droids and follow rtoo over to
a computer wall socket. The two Jedi fight off more
Droids as Artoo tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a
Hhologram of the Trade Federation ship appears.
OBI-WAN
The Chancellor's signal is coming
from right there. The observation
platform at the top of that spire.
ANAKIN
I sense Count Dooku...
OBI-WAN
I sense a trap.
ANAKIN
Next move?
OBI-WAN
Spring the trap.
The Jedi start to leave; ARTOO follows. The Jedi stop and
turn to ARTOO.
ANAKIN
Artoo, go back. I need you to stay
with the ship.
OBI-WAN
Here, take this, and wait for
orders.
OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to Artoo.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS enters the bridge. He walks to the front
of the bridge and stands in front of the captain.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
What's the situation, Captain?
CAPTAIN
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Just as Count Dooku predicted.
Anakin and Obi-Wan head for the elevator. A door opens in the
hallway and two of GENERAL-GRIEVOUS's Bodyguards confront the
Jedi.
BODYGUARD I
General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker.
We've been waiting for you.
OBI-WAN
We are here to relieve you of
Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.
As a dozen more Droids join the group, the Jedi ignite their
lightsabers and stand back-to-back.
OBI-WAN
Anakin...
ANAKIN
Ready.
Anakin and Obi-Wan use their lightsabers and cut a large
circle in the floor.
The Two Jedi cut their way down several floors into a large
generator room.
Huge Explosions outside the ship have caused several large
pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The
Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his
hand into the fluid and sniffs it.
OBI-WAN
... fuel. The slightest charge from
our sabers will send this ship into
oblivion. That's why they've stopped
shooting.
ANAKIN
Well then, we're safe for the time
being.
OBI-WAN
Your idea of safe is not the same as
mine.
They run, Explosions rattle the ship, and pipes continue to
burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At
the far end, Six Super Battle Droids drop into the fuel. They pass several
large power generators, which are topped with sparking excess
power dischargers.
ANAKIN
They're sealing this section off.
OBI-WAN
Six Droids coming our way!
The last of the door can be heard closing in the distance.
ANAKIN
Keep moving. There must be vents...
This way.
They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small
vent. The fuel gets closer to the Sparking dischargers.
OBI-WAN
We'll never get through that. It's
too small!
They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the
fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling.
ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller
vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then
he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with
one of the Super Battle Droids. It pulls the Jedi under the
fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.
The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very
small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate
breaks loose.
ANAKIN
I found our escape vent.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, this is no time for jokes.
We're in serious trouble here.
ANAKIN
Only in your mind. My Master. Look,
no structure...
ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big
yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized"
work shaft. They scramble through it as the Droids swim
closer.
The Two Jedi pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft
until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.
ANAKIN
Here's a way out.
As the Super Battle Droids reach the opening in the ceiling
and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator
sparks, the Jedi work the keyboard on the pressure lock,
opening the latch.
The Two Jedi climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch
shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft
until they reach the end.
A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade
Federation Cruiser, and the Jedi squeeze out, SLAMMING the
hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser
sword.
OBI-WAN
That won't hold when the fuel hits
those power dischargers.
ANAKIN
The blast will break the hull. This
side's pressurized.
OBI-WAN
You still have much to learn,
Anakin.
The Super Battle Droids climb up the vent shaft. R77 and 
everal other Droids wait in the generator room
as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID R77
I have a bad feeling about this.
The fuel hits the sparking power discharger, and there is a
HUGE Explosion.
A GREAT Explosion and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the
side of the Federation Cruiser.
A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as
the Explosion hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.
OBI-WAN
All right, you win. I have much to
learn. Let's go!
ANAKIN grins at Obi-Wan and they run down the hallway.
The two Jedi wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around
and see they are face to face with Three Destroyer Droids.
The Droids start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts.
OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more
times.
ANAKIN
Destroyers!!
Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of
laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The Jedi turn to
see Battle Droids standing behind them.
BATTLE-DROID
Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.
The Jedi activate their light sabers and destroy all the
Battle Droids.
R2-D2 notices two Super Battle Droids entering the hangar. He
moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.
The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.
OBI-WAN
Did you press the stop button?
ANAKIN
No, did you?
OBI-WAN
No!
ANAKIN
Well, there's more than one way out
of here.
ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.
OBI-WAN
We don't want to get out, we want to
get moving. Artoo... Artoo. Do you
copy? Activate elevator...
(looks at control panel)
... 31174...
ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.
Two Super Battle Droids are inspecting the Jedi Starfighters.
They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are
distracted.
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID 1
What's that?
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID 2
Get back to work. It's nothing.
OBI-WAN
Artoo?
ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the
elevator.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Always on the move.
OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps
a reply.
ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the Two Battle
Droids try to figure out where the voices are coming from.
ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.
OBI-WAN
Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo,
do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a
job to do! Artoo.
Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN
quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He
watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and
disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed
door as sparking wires rain down on him.
The elevator starts to descend rapidly.
OBI-WAN
Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be
going up.
Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the
elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open,
and Two Battle Droids appear in the doorway and look down at
ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.
DROID-1
Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.
DROID-2
Roger, roger.
The Two Super Battle Droids overhear OBI-WAN's comlink
messages to ARTOO.
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID 1
There it is again.
OBI-WAN
Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you
hear me? Artoo, we need to be going
up, not down.
The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.
OBI-WAN
Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop,
stop!
The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.
The Two Super Battle Droids see ARTOO and walk toward the
little droid.
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID 1
Hey you!
ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots
up.
OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.
OBI-WAN
Now, that's better...
ARTOO is held up by Two Super Battle Droids, who chuckle as
the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID-1
You stupid little astro droid!
ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at
a high rate of speed. He looks at the Battle Droids leaning
over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a
moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into
the elevator shaft.
Before Anakin can arc into a descent down the shaft, the
elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the Droids in
two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back
through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and
ignites his lightsaber.
OBI-WAN
Oh, it's you...
ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the Super Battle
Droids. The Super Battle Droids slip on the oil.
ANAKIN
What was that all about?
OBI-WAN
Well, Artoo has been...
ANAKIN
No loose wire jokes... He's doing
the best he can.
OBI-WAN
Did I say anything?
ANAKIN
He's trying!
OBI-WAN
I didn't say anything!
ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip,
spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The
Super Battle Droids slip and slide until they fall,
smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.
The elevator door opens and the Two Jedi carefully make their
way into the main room of the General's Quarters.
At the far end sits Chancellor Palpatine. Anakin and
Obi-Wan move toward the Chancellor.
As they get closer to Palpatine, they see a very distressed
look on the Chancellor's face.
OBI-WAN
(bows)
Chancellor.
ANAKIN
Are you all right?
PALPATINE
(quietly)
Count Dooku.
PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. Obi-wan and
Anakin turn around. He is above
the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two Super Battle
Droids. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.
OBI-WAN
(quietly to Anakin)
This time we will do it together.
ANAKIN
I was about to say that.
COUNT-DOOKU jumps down to the main level.
PALPATINE
Get help! You're no match for him.
He's a Sith Lord.
OBI-WAN
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are
our specialty.
Obi-Wan and Anakin throw off their cloaks and ignite their
lightsabers.
COUNT-DOOKU
Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We
don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the Chancellor.
Obi-Wan and Anakin move toward Dooku.
OBI-WAN
You won't get away this time, Dooku.
Obi-Wan and Anakin charge Dooku. A great sword fight
ensues.
COUNT-DOOKU
I've been looking forward to this.
ANAKIN
My powers have doubled since the
last time we met, Count.
COUNT-DOOKU
Good. Twice the pride, double the
fall.
DOOKU lunges at the Jedi and they fall back...
COUNT-DOOKU
(continuing)
Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi... too
predictable. You'll have to do
better.
As the battle proceeds, they are tired.
ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to
drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT-DOOKU throws Obi-Wan back
using the Force.
Anakin and Dooku move up the stairs. As they reach the
upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over
Dooku. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs,
destroying Two Super Battle Droids. COUNT-DOOKU holds Obi-Wan
in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks Anakin out
of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.
ANAKIN hits the archway.
DOOKU sends Obi-Wan flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower
level unconscious. COUNT-DOOKU spins around again and, using
the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN spins and kicks Dooku, sending him over the
balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor.
COUNT-DOOKU continues the fight.
COUNT-DOOKU
(continuing)
I sense great fear in you,
Skywalker. You have hate, you have
anger, but you donâ€™t use them.
Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT-DOOKU as the
Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their
fighting becomes even more intense.
Anakin attacks Dooku with a new ferociousness.
Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense!
Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT-DOOKU's hands. 
The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops
from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT-DOOKU stumbles to
the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck.
PALPATINE is grinning as he watches Count Dooku's defeat.
PALPATINE
Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could
do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
ANAKIN
I shouldn't...
PALPATINE
Do it!!
ANAKIN cuts off Count Dooku's head. A huge Explosion
somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.
ANAKIN
... I couldn't stop myself.
PALPATINE
You did well, Anakin. He was too
dangerous to be kept alive.
ANAKIN drops Count Dooku's lightsaber, moving to Palpatine.
ANAKIN
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
ANAKIN raises his hands toward Palpatine, who is strapped in
the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.
ANAKIN
I shouldn't have done that,
Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.
PALPATINE
It is only natural. He cut off your
arm, and you wanted revenge. It
wasn't the first time, Anakin.
Remember what you told me about your
mother and the Sand People. Now, we
must leave before more security
Droids arrive.
The ship begins to list to one side. Anakin rushes over to
Obi-Wan, lifts the control console from on top of him, and
pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious
friend. Palpatine heads for the elevators.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
Anakin, there is no time. We must
get off the ship before it's too
late.
ANAKIN
He seems to be all right. No broken
bones, breathing's all right.
PALPATINE
Leave him, or we'll never make it.
ANAKIN
His fate will be the same as ours.
ANAKIN picks up Obi-Wan, slings him over his shoulder, and
heads for the elevators.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Prepare for attack.
PILOT
All batteries fire! Fire!
Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation Cruiser and take
fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone
troopers go flying.
ANAKIN carries Obi-Wanto the elevator doors and hits the
button.
PALPATINE joins him.
ANAKIN
The elevator's not working,
(into his comlink)
Artoo...
ARTOO beeps a response to Anakin.
ANAKIN
... Activate Elevator 3224.
Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors
open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the
door frame of the elevator.
ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.
ANAKIN
Artoo... do you copy? Artoo, come in!
Windows are blown out, Droids and equipment are sucked into
space.
PILOT
Reverse stabilizers.
As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one
side of the ship to the other.
Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing
objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward
one of the small holes.
As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.
ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with Obi-Wan on his shoulder,
as the Chancellor struggles to join him.
ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He
swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the Battle
Droids stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a
zap. ARTOO beeps a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the
Battle Droids. One bolt hits very near him, and he Screams in
terror.
PILOT
Magnetize! Magnetize!
ARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding
behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts
and the fighter bounces over him.
The Trade Federation Cruiser heads straight down toward the
planet.
ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN
still on his shoulder.
ANAKIN
We can't wait. Come on, we have to
be fast.
PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start
running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the
Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator
to the other.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Fire the emergency booster engines.
PILOT
Leveling out, sir.

ANAKIN still carrying Obi-Wan on his back, and Palpatine run
down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN
cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors
can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and
Palpatine to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some
wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto
the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left
hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.

They hang precariously on the side
of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains
consciousness and tries to look around.
ANAKIN
Easy... We're in a bit of a
situation.
OBI-WAN
Did I miss something?
OBI-WAN looks down and sees Palpatine and the bottomless pit.
They hear Artoo Beeping on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins
to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a fortyfive-
degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and
look up to see the elevator heading toward them.
ANAKIN
Hold on.
OBI-WAN
What is that?
Obi-Wan and Anakin look up to watch the elevator approach
them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Oops.
ANAKIN
Artoo, Artoo, shut down the
elevator!
OBI-WAN
Too late! Jump!
They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the
ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft
and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The
shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
Anakin and Obi-Wan take out and throw grappling hooks. The
hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the
elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open
door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.
They fly through the elevator door and land.
OBI-WAN
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still
flyable. Come on.
ANAKIN
Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you
copy?

As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO squeals
and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken Battle Droid
Parts. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.
Obi-Wan and Anakin lead Palpatine down a hallway toward the
hangar bay.
It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually
sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great
stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering
the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading
into the hangar bay.
OBI-WAN
None of those ships will get us
anywhere.
ANAKIN
I agree.
PALPATINE
What are we going to do?
ANAKIN
I don't know.
OBI-WAN
Don't look at me. I don't know.
Anakin and Palpatine both look to Obi-Wan. He shrugs his
shoulders.
Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is
totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.
ANAKIN
Here, Chancellor, lock this around
your waist, and hold on.
OBI-WAN
We'll head toward the bridge and see
if we can find an escape pod.
ANAKIN hands Palpatine the end of a cable that is attached to
his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist.
Anakin and Obi-Wan throw their utility cables to some pipes
in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.
OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the
ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar,
Two Super Battle Droids start firing at him. The Jedi ignites
his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the Droids,
blowing them up.
Anakin and Palpatine follow Obi-Wan along the pipes running
along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against
the escaping air of the pressurized hangar.
PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of
steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe
as the Chancellor dangles on the other end of the utility
cable. They are surrounded by Sparks and Explosions as the
ship twists and tries to break apart.
ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull Palpatine
back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the
buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing
pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe
go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make
it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.
OBI-WAN, Anakin and Palpatine are out of breath.
ANAKIN/OBI-WAN
Well, that was close.
They laugh.
BODYGUARD
General, we found the Jedi. They're
in hallway 328.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Activate ray shields.
They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around
them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the
hallway.
ANAKIN
Ray shields!
OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total
disappointment.
OBI-WAN
Wait a minute, how'd this happen!
We're smarter than this.
ANAKIN
Apparently not, Master. This is the
oldest trap in the book... Well... I
was distracted.
OBI-WAN
Oh, so all of a sudden it's my
fault.
ANAKIN
You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
OBI-WAN
I'm open to suggestions here.
PALPATINE
Why don't we let them take us to
General Grievous. Perhaps with Count
Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our
release.
The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.
ANAKIN
I say... patience.
OBI-WAN
Patience! That's your plan, is it?
ANAKIN
Yes, Artoo will be along in a few
moments and he'll release the ray
shields...
ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the
opposite wall.
He takes a moment to compose himself.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
See! No problem.
Suddenly several doorways open, revealing Two Destroyer
Sixteen Super Battle Droids emerge from behind the Destroyer
Droids.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the Super Battle Droids who then
kicks ARTOO over.
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID
Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.
OBI-WAN
Do you have a plan B?
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL
GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Oh yes. General Kenobi, the
Negotiator. We've been waiting for
you. That wasn't much of a rescue.
A Battle Droid walks to General Grievous and hands him the
Jedi'S lightsabers.
OBI-WAN
That depends upon your point of
view. Hah!
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
And Anakin Skywalker... I was
expecting someone with your
reputation to be a little older.
ANAKIN
General Grievous... Supreme
Commander of the Droid Armies.
You're shorter than I expected.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Ahhhh, Jedi scum...
OBI-WAN
Anakin, try not to upset him. We
have a job to do.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Your lightsabers will make a fine
addition to my collection.
OBI-WAN
Not this time. And this time you
won't escape.
ANAKIN
Artoo.
ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms,
shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around,
reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of
the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He
continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Crush them! Make them suffer!
ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the
General's hand.
The Droids that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and
ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates
into chaos. Obi-Wan and Anakin are locked in a pitched battle
between electro staffs and laser swords with General Grievous's Two Bodyguards.
CHANCELLOR-PALPATINE is taken away by two Battle Droids.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the Battle
Droids.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Stay and watch your stations.
OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's Bodyguards. The
BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long.
When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere
and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the
staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times
and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off
the Droid Bodyguard's head. The Droid Bodyguard keeps
attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the
other manic Droid Bodyguard. He cuts the Droid Bodyguard in
half. Two Battle Droids try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down,
rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN finishes off the headless Bodyguard. It crumbles to
the floor in pieces.
Alarms sound as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall
out of orbit. A Pilot yells at General Grievous.
PILOT
Sir, we are falling out of orbit.
All aft control cells are dead.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Stay on course... Don't bother with
them. Keep the ship in orbit.
Obi-Wan and Anakin destroy the remaining Droids. GENERAL-GRIEVOUS retrieves 
one of the Bodyguard'S staffs and faces Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind General Grievous.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
You lose, General Kenobi.
One of the Pilots stands next to the General.
PILOT
The ship is breaking up!
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
We've run out of time.
OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL-GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the
General from the opposing side. GENERAL-GRIEVOUS turns and
throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks,
causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked
into space. GENERAL-GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into
space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the
ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.
They hold on for dear life. A blast
shield closes around where the window used to be.
OBI-WAN continues to fight the Battle Droids. The Droids have
backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control
panel as the Droids blast away at him. He jumps up and over
the Droids, cutting most of them down before he lands. He
destroys the Droids and joins Anakin.
Anakin and Obi-Wan cut through the rest of the Droids as if
they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he
watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. They
stand back to back and cut down the last of
the Droids just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more
alarms. Sparks begin to fly outside the windows.
PALPATINE
The hull is burning up!
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the
exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized
hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an
airlock.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch.
The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape
pod.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Time to abandon ship.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the
escape pods are jettisoned.
He gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts
away from the damaged Cruiser.
Obi-Wan and Anakin go over to the navigator's chair.
ANAKIN
All the escape pods have been
launched.
OBI-WAN
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like
this?
ANAKIN
You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing?
ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the
back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and
the ship tilts forward.
OBI-WAN
Well?
ANAKIN
Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is
irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
Obi-Wan and Palpatine strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN
struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to
glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's
controls and assists in flying the cruiser.
OBI-WAN
Steady... Attitude... eighteen
degrees.
ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN
Pressure rising. We've got to slow
this wreck down. Open all hatches,
extend all flaps, and drag fins.
OBI-WAN
Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps
extended, drag fins...
A large part of the ship breaks away.
ANAKIN
We lost something.
OBI-WAN
Not to worry, we're still flying
half the ship.
ANAKIN
Now we're really picking up speed...
I'm going to shift a few degrees and
see if I can slow us down.
OBI-WAN
Careful... we're heating up-twelve
thousand... thirteen thousand...
ANAKIN
What's our speed?
OBI-WAN
Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus
sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp
ten thousand, nine thousand... we're
in the atmosphere...
ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.
ANAKIN
Grab that... Keep us level.
OBI-WAN
Steady. Steady.
ANAKIN
Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a
little rough. We lost our heat
shields.
OBI-WAN
Five thousand. Three thousand... two
thousand. Fireships on the left and
the right.
FIRESHIP-PILOT
We'll take you in.
OBI-WAN
Copy that. Landing strip's straight
ahead.
ANAKIN
We're coming in too hot.
OBI-WAN
Easy-easy.
The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant
skyline.
Palpatine and Obi-Wan hold on for dear life as the ship
shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.
A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city
is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship
approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship
finally makes a rather hard landing.
OBI-WAN
Another happy landing.
The small Jedi Shuttle carrying Palpatine and the Jedi
arrives at the landing platform.
ANAKIN
(to Obi-Wan)
Are you coming, Master?
OBI-WAN
Oh no. I'm not brave enough for
politics. I have to report to the
Council. Besides, someone needs to
be the poster boy.
ANAKIN
Hold on, this whole operation was
your idea. You planned it. You led
the rescue operation. You have to be
the one to take the bows this time.
OBI-WAN
Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget
that you rescued me from the Buzz
Droids. And you killed Count Dooku.
And you rescued the Chancellor,
carrying me unconscious on your
back, and you managed to land that
bucket of bolts safely...
ANAKIN
All because of your training,
Master. You deserve all those
speeches of your greatness.
OBI-WAN
... the endless speeches... Anakin,
let's be fair. Today, you are the
hero and you deserve your glorious
day with the politicians.
ANAKIN
All right. But you owe me... and not
for saving your skin for the tenth
time...
OBI-WAN
Ninth time... that business on Cato
Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you
at the briefing.
ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
The Chancellor and his entourage approach Mace.
MACE WINDU
Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome
sight! Are you all right?
PALPATINE
Yes, thanks to your two Jedi
Knights. They killed Count Dooku,
but General Grievous has escaped
once again.
MACE WINDU
General Grievous will run and hide
as he always does. He is a coward.
PALPATINE
That maybe true, but with Count
Dooku dead, he is the leader of the
Droid Army, and I assure you, the
Senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.
MACE WINDU
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest
priority.
Bail, Anakin, and the crowd walk away from the platform
toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.
BAIL-ORGANA
Skywalker, the Republic cannot
praise you enough.
Anakin and Bail Organa, walking in the hallway.
ANAKIN
Thank you, Senator Organa. The
kidnapping was a bold move by the
Separatists, but it was a mistake
that Obi-Wan and I were able to take
advantage of.
Artoo and C-3PO follow behind the crowd.
C-3PO
It couldn't possibly be as bad as
all that.
ARTOO beeps.
C-3PO
(continuing)
Well, there, I agree with you. In
fact, I could do with a tune-up
myself.
ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of Senators, talking with
Bail Organa. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.
BAIL-ORGANA
The end of Count Dooku will surely
bring an end to this war, and an end
to the Chancellor's draconian
security measures.
ANAKIN
I wish that were so, but the
fighting is going to continue until
General Grievous is spare parts...
The Chancellor is very clear about
that.
Behind a row of large columns, a Shadow follows the
Jedi and the Senator. ANAKIN senses the figure.
BAIL-ORGANA
I'll do everything I can with the
Senate.
ANAKIN
Excuse me.
BAIL-ORGANA
Certainly.
ANAKIN stops, and Bail goes off after Palpatine and the
others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet
up with the Shadow, who is revealed to be Senator
Padme. They embrace and kiss.
PADME
Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're
back.
ANAKIN
I missed you, Padme. I've missed you
so.
PADME
There were whispers... that you'd
been killed. I've been living with
unbearable dread.
ANAKIN
I'm back, I'm all right. It feels
like we've been apart for a
lifetime. And it might have been...
If the Chancellor hadn't been
kidnapped. I don't think they would
have ever brought us back from the
Outer Rim sieges.
ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.
PADME
Wait, not here...
He grabs her again.
ANAKIN
Yes, here! I'm tired of all this
deception. I don't care if they know
we're married.
PADME
Anakin, don't say things like that.
You're important to the Republic...
to ending this war. I love you more
than anything, but I won't let you
give up your life as a Jedi for
me...
ANAKIN
I've given my life to the Jedi
order, but I'd only give up my life,
for you.
PADME
(playfully)
I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't
like that one bit. Patience, my
handsome Jedi... Come to me later.
ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.
ANAKIN
Are you all right? You're trembling.
What's going on?
PADME
I'm just excited to see you.
ANAKIN
That's not it. I sense more... what
is it?
PADME
Nothing... nothing...
ANAKIN
You're frightened.
(a little angry)
Tell me what's going on!
PADME begins to cry.
PADME
You've been gone five months... it's
been very hard for me. I've never
felt so alone. There's...
ANAKIN
... Is there someone else?
PADME
(peeved, angry)
No! Why do you think that? Your
jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin.
I do nothing to betray you, yet you
still don't trust me. Nothing has
changed.
ANAKIN
(sheepish)
I'm afraid of losing you, Padme...
that's all.
PADME
I will never stop loving you,
Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
ANAKIN
It's just that I've never seen you
like this...
PADME
Something wonderful has happened.
They look at each other for a long moment.
PADME
(continuing)
I'm... Annie, I'm pregnant.
ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications
of this. He takes her in his arms.
ANAKIN
That's... that's wonderful.
PADME
What are we going to do?
ANAKIN
We're not going to worry about
anything right now, all right? This
is a happy moment. The happiest
moment of my life.
A small Neimodian Shuttle lands. Battle Droids surround the
ramp as General Grievous descends onto the platform. Super
Battle Droid approaches.
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID The planet is secure, sir. The
population is under control.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Good. Where is the Separatist
Council?
SUPER-BATTLE-DROID
This way, sir ...
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He
enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on
the table, and bows.
A hologram of DARTH-SIDIOUS appears.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
Yes, Lord Sidious.
DARTH-SIDIOUS
General Grievous, I suggest you move
the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
It will be done, My Lord.
DARTH-SIDIOUS
The end of the war is near, General,
and I promise you, victory is
assured.
The hologram of Sidious talks to Grievous about the death of
Count Dooku.
GENERAL-GRIEVOUS
But the loss of Count Dooku?
DARTH-SIDIOUS
His death was a necessary loss,
which will ensure our victory. Soon
I will have a new apprentice... one
far younger and more powerful than
Lord Tyranus.
PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans
against the wall, watching her lovingly.
ANAKIN
... every second I was thinking of
you. Protecting the endless,
nameless Outer Rim settlements
became a torture... the battles were
easy, the longing became
unbearable... I've never been so
happy as I am at this moment.
PADME
Annie, I want to have our baby back
home on Naboo. We could go to the
lake country where no one would
know... where we would be safe. I
could go early-and fix up the baby's
room. I know the perfect spot, right
by the gardens.
ANAKIN
You are so beautiful!
PADME
It's only because I'm so in love...
ANAKIN
No, it's because I'm so in love with
you.
PADME
So love has blinded you?
ANAKIN
Well, that's not exactly what I
meant...
PADME
But it's probably true!
They laugh.
ANAKIN
I haven't laughed in so long...
PADME
Neither have I.
The view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on
a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and
is screaming.
PADME
Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin!
Anakin, I love you. I love you.
She screams and dies.
ANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks
over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him.
ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of
the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his
hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room
down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.
PADME
Anakin??
She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.
ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda.
The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the
battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught. PADME
descends the stairs and joins Anakin on the veranda. She
takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.
PADME
What's bothering you?
ANAKIN
Nothing...
ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that
Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I remember when I gave this to you.
PADME
Anakin, how long is it going to take
for us to be honest with each other?
ANAKIN
It was a dream.
PADME
Bad?
ANAKIN
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother just before she died.
PADME
And?
ANAKIN
It was about you.
They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.
PADME
Tell me.
ANAKIN
It was only a dream.
PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep
breath.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
You die in childbirth...
PADME
And the baby?
ANAKIN
I don't know.
PADME
It was only a dream.
ANAKIN takes Padme in his arms.
ANAKIN
... I won't let this one become
real, Padme.
They embrace, then part.
PADME
Anakin, this baby will change our
lives. I doubt the Queen will
continue to allow me to serve in the
Senate, and if the Council discovers
you are the father, you will be
expelled from the Jedi Order.
ANAKIN
I know â€¦.
PADME
Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might
be able to help us?
ANAKIN
(suspicious)
Have you told him anything?
PADME
No, but he's your mentor, your best
friend... he must suspect something.
ANAKIN
He's been a father to me, but he's
still on the Council. Don't tell him
anything!
PADME
I won't, Anakin.
ANAKIN
I don't need his help... Our baby is
a blessing, not a problem.
Yoda and Anakin sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought.
YODA
Premonitions... premonitions...
Hmmmm... these visions you have...
ANAKIN
They are of pain, suffering,
death...
YODA
Yourself you speak of, or someone
you know?
ANAKIN
Someone...
YODA
... close to you?
ANAKIN
Yes.
YODA
Careful you must be when sensing the
future, Anakin. The fear of loss is
a path to the dark side.
ANAKIN
I won't let these visions come true,
Master Yoda.
YODA
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice for those around you who
transform into the Force. Mourn
them, do not. Miss them, do not.
Attachment leads to jealousy. The
shadow of greed, that is.
ANAKIN
What must I do, Master Yoda?
YODA
Train yourself to let go of
everything you fear to lose.

ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi
Briefing Room. Several Jedi are exiting.

ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches
the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. OBI-WAN
remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off
some holograms and electronic charts and maps.
OBI-WAN
You missed the report on the Outer
Rim sieges.
ANAKIN
I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no
excuse.
OBI-WAN
In short, they are going very well.
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
ANAKIN
What's wrong then?
OBI-WAN
The Senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the Chancellor
today.
ANAKIN
Well, that can only mean less
deliberating and more action. Is
that bad? It will make it easier for
us to end this war.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, be careful of your friend
Palpatine.
ANAKIN
Be careful of what?
OBI-WAN
He has requested your presence.
ANAKIN
What for?
OBI-WAN
He would not say.
ANAKIN
He didn't inform the Jedi Council?
That's unusual, isn't it?
OBI-WAN
All of this is unusual, and it's
making me feel uneasy. You're
probably aware that relations
between the Council and the
Chancellor are stressed.
ANAKIN
I know the Council has grown wary of
the Chancellor's power, mine also
for that matter. Aren't we all
working together to save the
Republic? Why all this distrust?
OBI-WAN
The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we
are all affected by it. Be wary of
your feelings.
Anakin stands with Palpatine at his window overlooking the
vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed.
A brown haze hangs over the landscape.
PALPATINE
Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is
going to call on me to take direct
control of the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN
The Jedi will no longer report to
the Senate?
PALPATINE
They will report to me...
personally. The Senate is too
unfocused to conduct a war. This
will bring a quick end to things.
ANAKIN
I agree, but the Jedi Council may
not see it that way.
PALPATINE
There are times when we must all
endure adjustments to the
constitution in the name of
security.
ANAKIN
With all due respect, sir, the
Council is in no mood for more
constitutional amendments.
PALPATINE
Thank you, my friend, but in this
case I have no choice... this war
must be won.
ANAKIN
Everyone will agree on that.
PALPATINE
Anakin, I've known you since you
were a small boy. I have advised you
over the years when I could... I am
very proud of your accomplishments.
You have won many battles the Jedi
Council thought were lost... and you
saved my life. I hope you trust me,
Anakin.
ANAKIN
Of course.
PALPATINE
I need your help, son.
ANAKIN
What do you mean?
PALPATINE
I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps
pushing for more control. They're
shrouded in secrecy and obsessed
with maintaining their autonomy...
ideals. I find simply
incomprehensible in a democracy.
ANAKIN
I can assure you that the Jedi are
dedicated to the values of the
Republic, sir.
PALPATINE
Nevertheless, their actions will
speak more loudly than their words.
I'm depending on you.
ANAKIN
For what? I don't understand.
PALPATINE
To be the eyes, ears, and voice of
the Republic...
ANAKIN thinks about this.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
Anakin... I'm appointing you to be
my personal representative on the
Jedi Council.
ANAKIN
Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir,
but the Council elects its own
members. They will never accept
this.
PALPATINE
I think they will... they need you
more than you know.
BAIL-ORGANA
Now that he has control of the Jedi
Council, the Chancellor has
appointed Governors to oversee all
star systems in the Republic.
FANG-ZAR
When did this happen?
BAIL-ORGANA
The decree was posted this morning.
PADME
Do you think he will dismantle the
Senate?
MON-MOTHMA
Why bother? As a practical matter,
the Senate no longer exists.
GIDDEAN-DANU
The constitution is in shreds.
Amendment after amendment executive
directives, sometimes a dozen in one
day.
BAIL-ORGANA
We can't let a thousand years of
democracy disappear without a fight.
Everyone looks at each other, a little worried at the
implications of what was just said.
TERR-TANEEL
What are you suggesting?
BAIL-ORGANA
I apologize. I didn't mean to sound
like a Separatist.
MON-MOTHMA
We are not Separatists trying to
leave the Republic. We are
loyalists, trying to preserve
democracy in the Republic.
BAIL-ORGANA
It has become increasingly clear to
many of us that the Chancellor has
become an enemy of democracy.
PADME
I can't believe it has come to this!
Chancellor Palpatine is one of my
oldest advisors. He served as my
Ambassador when I was Queen.
GLDDEAN-DANU
Senator, I fear you underestimate
the amount of corruption that has
taken hold in the Senate.
MON-MOTHMA
The Chancellor has played the
Senators well. They know where the
power lies, and they will do
whatever it takes to share in it.
Palpatine has become a dictator and
we have helped him to do it.
BAIL-ORGANA
We can't sit around debating any
longer, we have decided to do what
we can to stop it. Senator Mon
Mothma and I are putting together an
organization...
PADME
Say no more. Senator Organa. I
understand. At this point, it's
better to leave some things unsaid.
BAIL-ORGANA
Yes. I agree and we must not discuss
this with anyone, without everyone
in this group agreeing.
MON-MOTHMA
That means those closest to you...
even family... no one can be told.
They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.
PADME
Agreed.
ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council
Chambers. The door opens.
ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is
surrounded by the Jedi Council
MACE
Anakin Skywalker, we have approved
your appointment to the Council as
the Chancellor's personal
representative.
ANAKIN
I will do my best to uphold the
principles of the Jedi Order.
YODA
Allow this appointment lightly, the
Council does not. Disturbing is this
move by Chancellor Palpatine.
ANAKIN
I understand.
MACE
You are on this Council, but we do
not grant you the rank of Master.
Anakin reacts with anger.
ANAKIN
What? ! How can you do this?? This
is outrageous, it's unfair... I'm
more powerful than any of you. How
can you be on the Council and not be
a Master?
MACE
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
ANAKIN
Forgive me, Master.
ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is
embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI speaks.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
We have surveyed all systems in the
Republic, and have found no sign of
General Grievous.
YODA
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous
is. The outlying systems, you must
sweep.
OBI-WAN
It may take some time... we do not
have many ships to spare.
MACE
We cannot take ships from the front
line.
OBI-WAN
And yet, it would be fatal for us to
allow the droid armies to regroup.
YODA
Master Kenobi, our spies contact,
you must, and then wait.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
What about the droid attack on the
Wookiees?
MACE
It is critical we send an attack
group there, immediately!
OBI-WAN
He's right, that is a system we
cannot afford to lose. It's the main
navigation route for the
southwestern quadrant.
ANAKIN
I know that system well. It would
take us little time to drive the
Droids off that planet.
MACE
Skywalker, your assignment is here
with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must
find General Grievous.
YODA
Go, I will. Good relations with the
Wookiees, I have.
MACE
It is settled then. Yoda will take a
battalion of clones to reinforce the
Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force
be with us all.
ANAKIN is disappointed.
Anakin and Obi-Wan walk through one of the massive Jedi
Temple hallways. Anakin is furious.
ANAKIN
What kind of nonsense is this, put
me on the Council and not make me a
Master!?? That's never been done in
the history of the Jedi. It's
insulting!
OBI-WAN
Calm down, Anakin. You have been
given a great honor. To be on the
Council at your age... It's never
happened before. Listen to me,
Anakin. The fact of the matter is
you're too close to the Chancellor.
The Council doesn't like it when he
interferes in Jedi affairs.
ANAKIN
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be
put on the Council...
OBI-WAN
But it's what you wanted! Your
friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.
ANAKIN
That has nothing to do with this.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, regardless of how it
happened, you find yourself in a
delicate situation.
ANAKIN
You mean divided loyalties.
OBI-WAN
I warned you there was tension
between the Council and the
Chancellor. I was very clear. Why
didn't you listen? You walked right
into it.
ANAKIN
The Council is upset I'm the
youngest to ever serve.
OBI-WAN
No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when
you speak of jealousy and pride.
Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're
dangerous, dark thoughts.
ANAKIN
Master, you of all people should
have confidence in my abilities. I
know where my loyalties lie.
OBI-WAN
I hope so...
ANAKIN
I sense there's more to this talk
than you're saying.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, the only reason the Council
has approved your appointment is
because the Chancellor trusts you.
ANAKIN
And?
OBI-WAN
Anakin, look, I am on your side. I
didn't want to see you put in this
situation.
ANAKIN
What situation?
OBI-WAN
(takes a deep breath)
The Council wants you to report on
all of the Chancellor's dealings.
They want to know what he's up to.
ANAKIN
They want me to spy on the
Chancellor? That's treason!
OBI-WAN
We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi
Council is sworn to uphold the
principles of the Republic, even if
the Chancellor does not.
ANAKIN
Why didn't the Council give me this
assignment when we were in session?
OBI-WAN
This assignment is not to be on
record. The Council asked me to
approach you on this personally.
ANAKIN
The Chancellor is not a bad man,
Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's
watched out for me ever since I
arrived here.
OBI-WAN
That is why you must help us,
Anakin. Our allegiance is to the
Senate, not to its leader who has
managed to stay in office long after
his term has expired.
ANAKIN
Master, the Senate demanded that he
stay longer. 
OBI-WAN
Yes, but use
your feelings, Anakin. Something is
out of place. You're asking me to do
something against the Jedi Code.
Against the Republic. Against a
mentor... and a friend. That's
what's out of place here. Why are
you asking this of me?
OBI-WAN
The Council is asking you.
A Jedi heads for the huge Clone landing platform.
OBI-WAN
Anakin did not take to his
assignment with much enthusiasm.
YODA
Too much under the sway of the
Chancellor, he is. Much anger there
is in him. Too much pride in his
powers.
MACE
It's very dangerous, putting them
together. I don't think the boy can
handle it. I don't trust him.
OBI-WAN
He'll be all right. I trust him with
my life.
MACE
I wish I did.
OBI-WAN
With all due respect, Master, is he
not the Chosen One? Is he not to
destroy the Sith and bring balance
to the Force?
MACE
So the prophecy says.
YODA
A prophecy... that misread could
have been.
OBI-WAN
He will not let me down. He never
has.
YODA
I hope right you are. And now
destroy the Droid armies on
Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be
with you.
The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the
GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then
take off in the Gunship.
Padme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN-TYPHO 
escorts Padme onto the veranda, where Two Handmaidens
are waiting. PADME turns to Captain Typho.
PADME
Thank you, Captain.
CAPTAIN-TYPHO
Rest well. My Lady.
CAPTAIN-TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears
into the cityscape. The Handmaidens, Motee and Elle, approach
Padme as the shadow moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.
PADME
I'll be up in a while.
MOTEE
Yes, my lady.
C-3PO stands, confused, as the Handmaidens turn and exit.
C-3PO
Is there anything I might do for
you, my lady?
PADME
Yes, make sure all the security
Droids are working. Thank you,
Threepio.
The golden droid turns and exits.
PADME stands and watches the sunset. The Shadow moves
toward her. She senses something.
ANAKIN
Beautiful, isn't it?
PADME jumps and turns around.
PADME
You startled me.
He sits next to her on the bench.
ANAKIN
How are you feeling?
PADME
He keeps kicking.
ANAKIN
He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
PADME
(laughs)
My motherly intuition.
She puts his hand on her belly.
ANAKIN
Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's
got to be a girl.
They laugh.
PADME
I heard about your appointment.
Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
ANAKIN
I may be on the Council, but... they
refused to accept me as a Jedi
Master.
PADME
Patience. In time, they will
recognize your skills.
ANAKIN
They still treat me as if I were a
Padawan learner... they fear my
power, that's the problem.
PADME
Anakin...
ANAKIN
Sometimes, I wonder what's happening
to the Jedi Order... I think this
war is destroying the principles of
the Republic.
PADME
Have you ever considered that we may
be on the wrong side?
ANAKIN
(suspicious)
What do you mean?
PADME
What if the democracy we thought we
were serving no longer exists, and
the Republic has become the very
evil we have been fighting to
destroy?
ANAKIN
I don't believe that. And you're
sounding like a Separatist!
PADME
Anakin, this war represents a
failure to listen... Now, you're
closer to the Chancellor than
anyone. Please, please ask him to
stop the fighting and let diplomacy
resume.
ANAKIN
(growing angry)
Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make
a motion in the Senate, where that
kind of a request belongs. I'm not
your errand boy. I'm not anyone's
errand boy!
PADME
What is it?
ANAKIN
Nothing.
PADME
Don't do this... don't shut me out.
Let me help you.
ANAKIN
You can't help me... I'm trying to
help you.
They look in each other's eyes.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I sense... there are things you are
not telling me.
PADME is startled at this.
PADME
I sense there are things you are not
telling me.
PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.
PADME
(continuing)
Hold me... like you did by the lake
on Naboo, so long ago... when there
was nothing but our love... No
politics, no plotting... no war.
ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box,
where the Chancellor is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-
Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake."
ANAKIN
You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
PALPATINE
Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have
good news. Our Clone Intelligence
Units have discovered the location
of General Grievous. He is hiding in
the Utapau system.
ANAKIN
At last, we'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.
PALPATINE
I would worry about the collective
wisdom of the Council if they didn't
select you for this assignment. You
are the best choice by far â€¦ but,
they can't always be trusted to do
the right thing.
ANAKIN
They try.
PALPATINE
Sit down,
(to his aides)
Leave us.
ANAKIN sits next to Palpatine. The Chancellor leans over to
him.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
Anakin, you know I'm not able to
rely on the Jedi Council. If they
haven't included you in their plot,
they soon will.
ANAKIN
I'm not sure I understand.
PALPATINE
You must sense what I have come to
suspect... the Jedi Council want
control of the Republic... they're
planning to betray me.
ANAKIN
I don't think...
PALPATINE
Anakin, search your feelings. You
know, don't you?
ANAKIN
I know they don't trust you...
PALPATINE
Or the Senate... or the Republic...
or democracy for that matter.
ANAKIN
I have to admit my trust in them has
been shaken.
PALPATINE
Why? They asked you to do something
that made you feel dishonest, didn't
they?
ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
They asked you to spy on me, didn't
they?
ANAKIN
I don't know... I don't know what to
say.
PALPATINE
Remember back to your early
teachings. Anakin. "All those who
gain power are afraid to lose it."
Even the Jedi.
ANAKIN
The Jedi use their power for good.
PALPATINE
Good is a point of view, Anakin. And
the Jedi point of view is not the
only valid one. The Dark Lords of
the Sith believe in security and
justice also, yet they are
considered by the Jedi to be...
ANAKIN
evil..
PALPATINE
... from a Jedi's point of view. The
Sith and the Jedi are similar in
almost every way, including their
quest for greater power. The
difference between the two is the
Sith are not afraid of the dark side
of the Force. That is why they are
more powerful.
ANAKIN
The Sith rely on their passion for
their strength. They think inward,
only about themselves.
PALPATINE
And the Jedi don't?
ANAKIN
The Jedi are selfless... they only
care about others.
PALPATINE smiles.
PALPATINE
Or so you've been trained to
believe. Why is it, then, that they
have asked you to do something you
feel is wrong?
ANAKIN
I'm not sure it's wrong.
PALPATINE
Have they asked you to betray the
Jedi code? The Constitution? A
friendship? Your own values? Think.
Consider their motives. Keep your
mind clear of assumptions. The fear
of losing power is a weakness of
both the Jedi and the Sith.
ANAKIN is deep in thought.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
Did you ever hear the tragedy of
Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
ANAKIN
No.
PALPATINE
I thought not. It's not a story the
Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith
legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark
Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so
wise he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians to
create life... He had such a
knowledge of the dark side that he
could even keep the ones he cared
about from dying.
ANAKIN
He could actually save people from
death?
PALPATINE
The dark side of the Force is a
pathway to many abilities some
consider to be unnatural.
ANAKIN
What happened to him?
PALPATINE
He became so powerful... the only
thing he was afraid of was losing
his power, which eventually, of
course, he did. Unfortunately, he
taught his apprentice everything he
knew, then his apprentice killed him
in his sleep.
(smiles)
Plagueis never saw it coming. It's
ironic he could save others from
death, but not himself.
ANAKIN
Is it possible to learn this power?
PALPATINE
Not from a Jedi.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
(holo)
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is
on Utapau. We have had no reports of
this from our agents.
MACE
(holo)
How could the Chancellor have come
by this information and we know
nothing about it? We have had
contact with Baron Papanoida and he
said no one was there.
ANAKIN
A partial message was intercepted in
a diplomatic packet from the
Chairman of Utapau.
YODA
Act on this, we must. The capture of
General Grievous will end this war.
Quickly and decisively we should
proceed.
OBI-WAN
Does everyone agree?
All the Jedi concur.
ANAKIN
The Chancellor has requested that I
lead the campaign.
They all look at Anakin a bit disturbed.
MACE
(a little peeved)
The Council will make up its own
mind who is to go, not the
Chancellor.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
Yes, this decision is ours to make.
ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.
YODA
A Master is needed, with more
experience.
MACE
Given our resources, I recommend we
send only one Jedi... Master Kenobi.
ANAKIN
He was not so successful the last
time he met Grievous.
Obi-Wan throws Anakin a dirty look.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
No offense, my Master, but I'm only
stating a fact.
OBI-WAN
Oh no, you're quite right, but I do
have the most experience with his
ways of combat.
YODA
Obi-Wan, my choice is.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
YODA
I agree.
All the Jedi concur.
MACE
Very well. Council is adjourned.
ANAKIN is angry.
MACE
(continuing)
Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades
as quickly as you can. If this
report is true, there's no telling
how many Battle Droids he may have
with him.
YODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the
platform.
CLONE-COMMANDER-GREE
The Droids have started up their
main power generators.
YODA
Then now the time is, Commander.
CLONE-COMMANDER-GREE
Yes, sir.
The battle begins. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the
ongoing battle.
Padme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded
city of Coruscant.
PADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.
OBI-WAN
Has Anakin been to see you?
PADME
Several times... I was so happy to
hear he was accepted on the Jedi
Council.
OBI-WAN
I know... he deserves it. He is
impatient, strong willed, very
opinionated, but truly gifted.
They laugh.
PADME
You're not just here to say hello.
Something is wrong, isn't it?
OBI-WAN
You should be a Jedi, Padme.
PADME
You're not very good at hiding your
feelings.
OBI-WAN
It's Anakin... He's becoming moody
and detached. He's been put in a
difficult position as the
Chancellor's representative... but I
think it's more than that. I was
hoping he may have talked to you.
PADME
Why would he talk to me about his
work?
OBI-WAN studies her.
OBI-WAN
Neither of you is very good at
hiding your feelings either.
PADME
Don't give me that look.
OBI-WAN
I know how he feels about you.
PADME
(nervous)
What did he say?
OBI-WAN
Nothing. He didn't have to.
PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows.
She walks to the balcony.
PADME
I don't know what you're talking
about.
OBI-WAN
I know you both too well. I can see
you two are in love. Padme, I'm
worried about him.
PADME looks down and doesn't answer.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
I fear your relationship has
confused him. He's changed
considerably since we returned...
They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning
city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into
the distant city.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Padme, I'm not telling the Council
about any of this. I ... I hope I
didn't upset you. We're all friends,
I care about both of you...
PADME
Thank you, Obi-Wan.
OBI-WAN
Please do what you can to help him.
C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.
PADME
We cannot let this turn into another war.
BAIL-ORGANA
Absolutely, that is the last thing
we want.
MON-MOTHMA
We are hoping to form an alliance in
the Senate to stop the Chancellor
from further subverting the
constitution, that's all.
PADME
I know a Jedi I feel it would be
wise to consult.
BANA BREEMU
That would be dangerous.
MON-MOTHMA
We don't know where the Jedi stand
in all this.
PADME
I only wish to discuss this with
one... one I trust.
GIDDEAN-DANU
Going against the Chancellor without
the support of the Jedi is risky.
PADME
The Jedi aren't any happier with the
situation than we are...
CHI EEKWAY
Patience, Senator.
FANG ZAR
We have so many Senators on our
side, surely that will pursuade the
Chancellor.
BANA-BREEMU
When you present the "petition of
the two thousand" to the Chancellor,
things may change.
BAIL-ORGANA
Let us see what we can accomplish in
the Senate, before we include the
Jedi.
ANAKIN
You're going to need me on this one,
Master.
OBI-WAN
Oh, I agree. However it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.
OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.
ANAKIN
Master!
OBI-WAN stops and Anakin walks over to him.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Master, I've disappointed you. I
have not been very appreciative of
your training... I have been
arrogant and I apologize... I've
just been so frustrated with the
Council. Your friendship means
everything to me.
OBI-WAN
You are strong and wise, Anakin, and
I am very proud of you. I have
trained you since you were a small
boy. I have taught you everything I
know. And you have become a far
greater Jedi than I could ever hope
to be, and you have saved my life
more times than I can remember. But
be patient, Anakin. It won't be long
before the Council makes you a Jedi
Master.
OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Don't worry. I have enough clones
with me to take three systems the
size of Utapau. I think I'll be able
to handle the situation... even
without your help.
ANAKIN
Well, there's always a first time.
OBI-WAN laughs.
They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBIWAN
depart.
ANAKIN
Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN
Good-bye, old friend. May the Force
be with you.
OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic
cruiser.
A hologram of the planet
Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.
CLONE-COMMANDER-CODY
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent
here... on the far side.
OBI-WAN
I'll keep them distracted until you
get there. Just don't take too long.
CLONE-COMMANDER-CODY
Come on, boss, when have I ever let
you down?
They laugh.
OBI-WAN
(laughing)
Cato Nemoidia... for starters.
OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.
CLONE-COMMANDER-CODY
That was Anakin who was late. I
believe.
OBI-WAN
Very well, the burden is on me not
to destroy all the Droids before you
get there.
CLONE-COMMANDER-CODY
I'm counting on you.
OBI-WAN blasts the Blue Jedi Fighter out of the Republic
Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the
planet Utapau.
PALPATINE
Well, Anakin, did you see your
friend off?
ANAKIN
He will soon have Grievous's head.
PALPATINE
We can only hope the Council didn't
make a mistake.
ANAKIN
The Council was very sure in its
decision.
They exit the landing platform.
JAR JAR
Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa
...
The Gungan waves to Anakin.
ANAKIN
Hi, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR
Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry,
Your Highness, sir.
Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.
PALPATINE
There are rumors in the Senate about
Master Kenobi. Many believe he is
not fit for this assignment.
ANAKIN
Not fit? Why would anyone think
that?
PALPATINE
They say his mind has become fogged
by the influence of a certain female
Senator.
ANAKIN
That's ridiculous. Who?!?
PALPATINE
(slyly)
No one knows who she is... only that
she is a Senator.
ANAKIN
That's impossible. I would know.
PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.
ANAKIN becomes worried.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
Idle Senate gossip is rarely true
and never accurate. I'm sure your
Master will do fine.
PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly
speaks to her.
OBI-WAN
Save your energy.
PADME
I can't!
OBI-WAN
Don't give up, Padme. Don't give
up...
ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch
where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind
him.
ANAKIN
I sense someone familiar... Obi-
Wan's been here, hasn't he?
PADME
He came by this morning.
ANAKIN
What did he want?
PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.
PADME
He's worried about you.
ANAKIN
You told him about us, didn't you?
She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.
PADME
He's your best friend, Anakin. He
says you're under a lot of stress.
ANAKIN
And he's not?
PADME
You have been moody lately.
ANAKIN
I'm not moody...
PADME
Anakin! Don't do this again.
ANAKIN
I don't know... I feel... lost.
PADME
Lost? What do you mean? You're
always so sure of yourself. I don't
understand.
ANAKIN
Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
PADME
They trust you with their lives.
Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
ANAKIN
Something's happening... I'm not the
Jedi I should be. I am one of the
most powerful Jedi, but I'm not
satisfied... I want more, and I know
I shouldn't.
PADME
You expect too much of yourself.
They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts
his hand on her belly.
ANAKIN
I have found a way to save you.
PADME
Save me?
ANAKIN
From my nightmares.
PADME
Is that what's bothering you?
ANAKIN
I won't lose you, Padme.
PADME
I'm not going to die in childbirth,
Annie. I promise you.
ANAKIN
No, I promise you! I am becoming so
powerful with my new knowledge of
the Force, I will be able to keep
you from dying.
PADME looks Anakin in the eye.
PADME
You don't need more power, Anakin. I
believe you can protect me against
anything, just as you are.
They embrace and kiss.
OBI-WAN blasts out of the Jedi Fighters's hyperspace ring
and heads for the planet Utapau. The Jedi Fighter skims over
the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.
