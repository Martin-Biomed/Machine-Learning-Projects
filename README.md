# Machine-Learning-Projects
A repository of some of the Machine Learning projects I've built using TensorFlow. Most of these are based on tutorials I found on the internet. Due to my personal interest, most of these projects revolve around neural networks.

These projects are mostly linked to using datasets I have stored in my personal Google Drive, hence the code keeps including links to it. I am uploading the datasets I've used in this repository as well.
